The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, there might be cases where the calculation results in unexpected values due to the order of operations or type conversion issues. For example, if you use `calc(100% - 10px)` and the element's parent is smaller than 10px wide, then the calculation results in a negative value and the element might not be displayed correctly or take up unexpected space.
